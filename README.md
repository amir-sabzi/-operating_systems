# Operating Systems
In this repository you can find drivers and kernel modules that I've written for the Operating systems (Kernel Programming) course.   
For more details you can read the README.m which is placed in the corresponding directory of each module.   
All codes were developed in ubuntu 18.04 (debian 10).
